	<brief_description>
		A cone-limited 3D twist joint.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Allows the attached bodies to rotate around the X axis of the joint, and hinge to specified limits around the other axes. The twist axis is calculated as the middle of the X axis of the joint in the local space of the two bodies.
