		Convex mesh shape resource for 3D physics.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		3D convex mesh shape resource to be added as a [i]direct[/i] child of a [PhysicsBody3D] or [Area3D] using a [CollisionShape3D] node. Unlike [ConcaveMeshShape3D], [ConvexMeshShape3D] cannot store concave polygon shapes.
		[b]Convex decomposition:[/b] Concave objects' collisions can be represented accurately using [i]several[/i] [ConvexMeshShape3D]s. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost). This is available in the editor by selecting the [MeshInstance3D], going to the [b]Mesh[/b] menu and choosing [b]Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings[/b]. Alternatively, [method MeshInstance3D.create_multiple_convex_collisions] can be called in a script to perform this decomposition at run-time.
		[b]Performance:[/b] [ConvexMeshShape3D] is faster to check collisions against compared to [ConcaveMeshShape3D], but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as [SphereShape3D] or [BoxShape3D]. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by a primitive shape.

			If set to [code]true[/code], duplicate and interior vertices are removed automatically. You can set it to [code]false[/code] to make the process faster if not needed.

			The mesh used to create the convex polygon shape.
