		<member name="dof_blur_far_amount" type="float" setter="set_dof_blur_far_amount" getter="get_dof_blur_far_amount" default="0.1">
			The amount of blur for far depth-of-field effects. The amount of blur increases the radius of the blur effect, making the affected area blurrier. However, If the amount is too high, you might start to see lines appearing, especially when using a low quality blur.
			[b]Note:[/b] Blur amount is currently dependent on the viewport resolution. At higher resolutions, you need to increase the blur amount to keep the same amount of blur relative to the camera's view space.
			[b]Note:[/b] If [member ProjectSettings.rendering/camera/depth_of_field/depth_of_field_bokeh_shape] is set to [b]Circle[/b], higher amounts are much slower to render compared to lower amounts. With [b]Box[/b] and [b]Hexagon[/b] bokeh shapes, blur amount doesn't affect performance significantly.

		<member name="dof_blur_far_distance" type="float" setter="set_dof_blur_far_distance" getter="get_dof_blur_far_distance" default="10.0">
			The distance from the camera where the far blur effect affects the rendering.
			[b]Note:[/b] It's recommended to avoid having the near and far blurs "cross" each other. Otherwise, artifacts may appear, especially if different amounts are chosen for both blurs.

			If [code]true[/code], enables the depth-of-field far blur effect. This has a significant performance cost. Consider disabling it in scenes where there are no far away objects.
		</member>
		<member name="dof_blur_far_transition" type="float" setter="set_dof_blur_far_transition" getter="get_dof_blur_far_transition" default="5.0">
			The length of the transition between the no-blur area and far blur. Higher values result in a smoother transition over distance.
