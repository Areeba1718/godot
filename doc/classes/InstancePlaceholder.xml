	<brief_description>
		Placeholder for the root [Node] of a [PackedScene].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Turning on the option [b]Load As Placeholder[/b] for an instanced scene in the editor causes it to be replaced by an [InstancePlaceholder] when running the game. This makes it possible to delay actually loading the scene until calling [method create_instance]. This is useful to avoid loading large scenes all at once by loading parts of it selectively.
		The [InstancePlaceholder] does not have a transform. This causes any child nodes to be positioned relatively to the [Viewport] from point (0,0), rather than their parent as displayed in the editor. Replacing the placeholder with a scene with a transform will transform children relatively to their parent again.

				Returns an instance of the scene handed as an argument, or the scene at [member instance_path] if no argument is given. As for all resources, the scene is loaded only if it's not loaded already. By manually loading the scene beforehand, delays caused by this function can be avoided. If [code]replace[/code] is [code]true[/code], replaces this placeholder by the created instance.

				Returns the changed properties and their values as key/value pairs. If [code]with_order[/code] is true, the dictionary will have an array with the property names in the order of modification under the key [code].order[/code].
