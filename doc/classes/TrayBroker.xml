		Broker agent for native communication with desktop.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Desktop components such as native file picker dialogs and notifications need to communicate with the desktop so they can be used inside the engine.
		This is a singleton tasked with doing communications with the desktop through the native methods (e.g. DBus for LinuxBSD and WinAPI for Windows platforms) and provides a broker end for engine classes (hence the name [TrayBroker]) so these use an unified and reusable interface.
