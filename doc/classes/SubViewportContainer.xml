		Control for holding [SubViewport]s.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A [Container] node that holds a [SubViewport]. It uses the [SubViewport]'s size as minimum size, unless [member stretch] is enabled.
		[b]Note:[/b] Changing a SubViewportContainer's [member Control.scale] will cause its contents to appear distorted. To change its visual size without causing distortion, adjust the node's margins instead (if it's not already in a container).
		[b]Note:[/b] The SubViewportContainer forwards mouse-enter and mouse-exit notifications to its sub-viewports.

			If [code]true[/code] and [member stretch_shrink] is not [code]0[/code], the sub-viewport will be automatically resized to the control's size.
			[b]Note:[/b] If [code]true[/code] and [member stretch_shrink] is not [code]0[/code], this will prohibit changing [member SubViewport.size] of its children manually.

		<member name="stretch_shrink" type="int" setter="set_stretch_shrink" getter="get_stretch_shrink" default="1">
			If not [code]0[/code], divides the sub-viewport's effective resolution by this value while preserving its scale. This can be used to speed up rendering.
			For example, a 1280×720 sub-viewport with [member stretch_shrink] set to [code]2[/code] will be rendered at 640×360 while occupying the same size in the container.
			[b]Note:[/b] [member stretch] must be [code]true[/code] for this property to work.
			[b]Note:[/b] If [code]0[/code], sub-viewport texture is stretched across the container regardless of its size or aspect ratio.
