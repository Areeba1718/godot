			The [Window] id number for an [InputEvent] from a [Window].
			By default the [member window_id] will be 0 for the main scene window.
			Embedded subwindows (see [method Window.is_embedded]) will have the same [member window_id] based on their parent [SubViewport]'s [member Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows] setting.
			Non-embedded subwindows will have a [member window_id] incremented by 1, with relation to the size of the display server's window list (see [method DisplayServer.get_window_list]).
			[b]See:[/b] Embedded subwindow settings can be configured in the [SubViewport]'s [member Viewport.gui_embed_subwindows] property and the project's advanced settings, Project Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Window -&gt; Subwindows -&gt; Embed Subwindows setting.
			[b]Note:[/b] Setting the [member window_id] of the [InputEventFromWindow] will not change the originating [Window]'s [member window_id].
			[b]Note:[/b] The [member window_id] should not be confused with the 'screen' a [Window] is displayed on (see [member Window.current_screen]).  There can be multiple [Window]s each with different [member window_id]s contained on the same screen.
