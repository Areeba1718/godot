	<description>
		This node allows child [PhysicsBone3D] nodes to inherit the velocity and rotational changes of another physics body.
		As an example, very often a [Skeleton3D] node is a child of some [KinematicBody3D]. Without this node, simulating [PhysicsBone3D] will not inherit velocity and rotational changes and appear to "stretch" and have exaggerated movement.
