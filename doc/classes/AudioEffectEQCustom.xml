		A custom equalizer that allows band frequencies to be customized and changed on the fly.
		Use it to create a custom equalizer if [AudioEffectEQ6], [AudioEffectEQ10] or [AudioEffectEQ21] don't fit your needs.

	<description>
		[AudioEffectEQCustom] is a semi-parametric equalizer that allows a custom setup of band frequencies. The setup can be changed in real time as well.
		An equalizer should contain at least 2 bands and at most 31 bands. The center frequencies should lie between 10 Hz and 22050 Hz (inclusive).
		It is suggested to ensure that band frequencies strictly increasing.
