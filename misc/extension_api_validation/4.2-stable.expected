This file contains the expected output of --validate-extension-api when run against the extension_api.json of the
4.2-stable tag (the basename of this file).

Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored. They
should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.

Add new entries at the end of the file.
