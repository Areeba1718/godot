<!--
Pull requests should always be made for the `master` branch first, as that's
where development happens and the source of all future stable release branches.
Relevant fixes are cherry-picked for stable branches as needed.

Do not create a pull request for stable branches unless the change is already
available in the `master` branch and it cannot be easily cherry-picked.
Alternatively, if the change is only relevant for that branch (e.g. rendering
fixes for the `3.x` branch).
