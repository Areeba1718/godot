This is simply a personal document to keep notes along my journey into the godot engine.

Installing SConstruct was as simple as running

```dos
 python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

 python -m pip install --user scons
 ```

 I did have to add global user scripts to my PATH, in my case `%APPDATA%\Python\Python310\Scripts` as I'm running *3.10.6*.
