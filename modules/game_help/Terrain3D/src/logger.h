 * Prints warnings, errors, and regular messages to the console.
 * Regular messages are filtered based on the user specified debug level.
 * Warnings and errors always print except in release builds.
 * DEBUG_CONT is for continuously called prints like inside snapping
 *
 * Note that in DEBUG mode Godot will crash on quit due to an
 * access violation in editor_log.cpp EditorLog::_process_message().
 * This is most likely caused by us printing messages as Godot is
 * attempting to quit.
