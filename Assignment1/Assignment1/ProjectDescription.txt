Implemented Project Features:

Room with walls that contains a light
Balls that shmoove
Bouncing Balls (off each other and walls)
A standstill camera
Random Ball Movement!

Weird feature is some of my code contains errors for recognizing some of the core & gen file
header files, but it works despite that.

You use the program by opening and running the project
