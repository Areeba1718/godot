JIT is a fork of Godot made in the odd event that it is ever needed. Not that I really have anything ageinst Godot, I love this engine! It's helping me make my dreams come true man! 

I just worry that something might go wrong with Godot's development at some point and I might be better off working with a code base that was made "before things went wrong"... 

I'm not gonna make my own game engine from scratch, ya know? That would be educational, but silly... so I'll probably just stick to Godot! And worst comes to worst I'll just become the head developer of my own Fork...

I mean this is why I pick only FOSS software in the first place, if the developers screw up too much, you just Fork is and move on with your life.

Politics should not get in the way of clean code!
