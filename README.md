## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that users can focus on making games
without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a
number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS,
Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms
(HTML5) and
[consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project) for several
years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.

## Getting the engine

### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot editor and the export templates can be found
[on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/download).

### Compiling from source

[See the official docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

## Getting Started

Godot is a full game engine with a very large number of features, this short guide should act as a jumping off point
but please feel free to [explore the docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) for additional in-depth
information.

### Step 1: Create a Project

To start your journey into Godot you will need a project to work on. There are a few ways to do this. You could create a 
new project of your own in the Local Projects tab, or you can browse the many community templates, demos and games in the Asset Library Projects tab.
It may be a good idea to explore an already established Godot project in order to learn how the many different functions of Godot interact

### Step 2: Explore Scenes, Nodes, and Signals

Once you have a project to work from, it will be important to understand that basic building blocks in Godot.
In Godot, we call those building blocks Scenes, Nodes, and Signals. At a high level, your game will be built from a
number of scenes. A scene could be a character, or an item, or a menu or any other sort of object that you could think of.
Scenes are the "things" your game is made of. Each scene is in turn, constructed of nodes. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of Godot.
Signals are the messages that a node emits when some pre-determined event happens. Through signals, nodes can communicate and interact, 
and influence scenes as your game runs.

And that's it! It may seem daunting, but getting started in Godot can be quick and easy. Exploration of the editor is an important part of learning all of the things that Godot can offer.
If this short how-to wasn't enough, [see this more detailed guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html)
for more instructions and explorations.

## Community and contributing

Godot is not only an engine but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the core engine developers is to join the
[Godot Contributors Chat](https://chat.godotengine.org).

To get started contributing to the project, see the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Documentation and demos

The official documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.godotengine.org).
It is maintained by the Godot community in its own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs).

The [class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/)
is also accessible from the Godot editor.

We also maintain official demos in their own [GitHub repository](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects)
as well as a list of [awesome Godot community resources](https://github.com/godotengine/awesome-godot).

There are also a number of other
[learning resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/tutorials.html)
provided by the community, such as text and video tutorials, demos, etc.
Consult the [community channels](https://godotengine.org/community)
for more information.
