JIT is a fork of Godot made in the odd event that it is ever needed. Not that I really have anything ageinst Godot, I love this engine! It's helping me make my dreams come true man! 

I just worry that something might go wrong with Godot's development at some point and I might be better off working with a code base that was made "before things went wrong"... 

I'm not gonna make my own game engine from scratch, ya know? That would be educational, but silly... so I'll probably just stick to Godot! And worst comes to worst I'll just become the head developer of my own Fork...

I mean this is why I pick only FOSS software in the first place, if the developers screw up too much, you just Fork is and move on with your life.

Politics should not get in the way of clean code!

I think what I'll do, going forward is this will just be a personal project for me to get better at game design in general. I'll keep the codebase more or less locked-in at the current version (4.4 beta) and free from any further Code upsteam, and only implament changes by hand, so I can meticulously inspect every code bit that goes into the system and insure "My" engine keeps in line with the clean design phlosphy Godot is known for, in case that ever changes. I'm not a super advanced Dev right now, but I'm old enough to know, sometimes it's just better to do these things youself. Which is why I picked a FOSS engine to begin with!

Hopfully this will just be good fun!
