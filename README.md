#### 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

Godot Engine is a feature-packed, cross-platform game engine used to create 2D
and 3D games from a unified interface. It provides a comprehensive set of
common tools that allow users to focus on making games without having to
reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms,
including the major desktop platforms (Linux, Mac OSX, Windows) as well as 
mobile (Android, iOS) and web-based (HTML5) platforms.

#### Free, open source and community-driven

Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license.
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to shape the engine to their expectations.
Godot is supported by the Software Freedom Conservancy not-for-profit charity.

Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan
Linietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining the project) for several
years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.

### Getting the engine

#### Binary downloads

Official binaries for the Godot editor and export templates can be found
[on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/download).

#### Compiling from source

[See the official docs](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/compiling/)
for compilation instructions for every supported platform.

### Community

Godot is not only an engine, but an ever-growing community of users and engine
developers. The main community channels are listed [on the homepage](https://godotengine.org/community).

The best way to get in touch with the Godot developers is to join the
[#godotengine IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=godotengine)
on Freenode.
