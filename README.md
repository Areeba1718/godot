 A 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine
</h3>
	

- **[Godot Engine ↗](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools & features ↗](https://godotengine.org/features), so that users can focus on making games
without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported with one click to a
number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS,
Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms
and [consoles ↗](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## 💸 Free, open source and 🚻 community-driven

- Godot is completely **Free** and **Open source** under the free of charge [MIT license ↗](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is also supported by the [Software Freedom Conservancy ↗](https://sfconservancy.org/)
not-for-profit.

> Before being open sourced in [February 2014 ↗](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky ↗](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur ↗](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project) for several
years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.
